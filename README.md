## Barbershop_Reservation

- [Repository](https://github.com/DinoKnezevic1/BarbershopReservationProject)

Final project for FIVE Agency(now Endava) Android academy.
Made with Kotlin, UI made using Jetpack Compose, primary database realized in Firebase for online conectivity.
I also used Room because I wanted to better myself, but it wasn't necessary because Firebase has offline capabilities.

Database is offline so the application doesn't work more because I only used it as a showcase. It has potential and 
could even be used in real world.

PS. Not all code is shown


App which was actually a tutorial application where we got an assignment after lectures so we could practice and work on it.
Application uses TMDB API with ROOM as a database. Kotlin and Jetpack Compose were used while making, for dependency injection we 
used Koin. Ktor was also used.

## Personal_Assistant

- [Repository](https://github.com/DinoKnezevic1/VirtualniTrenerZavrsniRad)


Application made for final project of my Bachelor's degree. 

Idea was to have an application for gym where user would get recommended a workout,
 and the application would adapt by making progressive overload in each workout.

Application was made using Kotlin, but UI was realized using View.
Database of choice was Firebase because of it's easy setup.

User can complete a workout and also has acces to all workouts history.
Some other features were planned but for future for example: graph representation of a progress on a certain exercise.
Application is on Croatian language.
